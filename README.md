## Summary
My final year MS degree thesis examined automation of the study of nonverbal communication through computer vision and machine learning, allowing for better speed and precision. The developed automated classification pipeline was run on video footage of the first and third presidential debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton to gauge its accuracy. Results showed the automated pipeline is viable as an easily upscaled replacement for human work, able to both reproduce the results of human labeling of the footage and allow for insight into the various nonverbal idiosyncrasies of the speakers with a high average accuracy (approx. 84% across both candidates).
